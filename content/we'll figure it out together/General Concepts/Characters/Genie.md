A kid with an extremely strong [[Soul]] who was sealed in a dungeon for how dangerous his power was long ago. 

## Modern Era
In the modern era, he is significantly weakened from people who have made their way through his dungeon and asked him for wishes. He longs to escape and get the pieces of his soul back and be restored to full power. Since he was sealed away so young he also has no real experience with things like true companionship. Mick helps him escape and track down the pieces of his soul, which inadvertently opens him up to things like violence and rage, which he finds intriguing and fun and makes him go off and start causing chaos for other people. Mick has to go and stop him, and they fight and stuff happens

## Abilities
### Presence
Genie is notable for having one of the strongest souls ever recoded. This gives him a control over the world greater than anyone else, allowing him to do things like control the elements, summon and transmute things, and even create illusions. He does not seem to possess any one specific ability, but commands complete control over his surroundings.

* Notably, due to his unfamiliarity with other people and unwillingness to ever not be whole again due to all his time spent in the dungeon, he cannot directly influence people anymore, and relies purely on external attacks and influences.

### Wishes
While he was imprisoned in the vault, he would grant wishes to people who could make it through to him by detaching pieces of his soul and attaching it to the people who make the wishes. While most people who make wishes wished for superficial things that don't require pieces of his soul
