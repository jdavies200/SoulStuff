Skilled in working with his hands, Guy from a young age worked around his village, acting as a carpenter, blacksmith, engineer, and whatever else. One day, upon being inspired by a swordsman, he decided to set out to become the world's best swordsman. Under the impression that a bigger sword will grant him greater strength, he forges a massive sword, the [[Icarus]], and sets out to challenge others.

He is not strong enough to actually swing the sword, so he just drags it along behind him, considering it "training". Doing so for a long while strengthens his legs more than his arms, and later he learns that [[Sword Kick|kicking the sword around]] nets him more positive results than swinging it. 

Many people are skeptical of whether he can even be considered a swordsman...
