Mick is an excitable boy with a penchant for reading people.

His character revolves around the fact that unlike other's whose [[Soul|Souls]] flow out of their bodies, which gives them the ability to externally shape the world around them, his soul is kept contained completely within his body, meaning he cannot affect things externally, but is much better at controlling himself than the average person.

It means his senses are quite adept, and he can read people very well. It also means that animals tend to like him, as they do not sense the soul flowing out of him and thus find him approachable.

He loves animals for this reason and gets very excited whenever he meets and connects with them in some way
