Everyone has a soul. Your soul is what connects you to this world, it is the core of your character, your personality, your views, your beliefs, all of it. The world is shaped by the souls of those who inhabit it, quite literally. The strength of one's soul indicates the amount of influence they can have on oneself and others.

A strong enough soul allows one to directly influence the world around them, usually manifesting in the form of an ability of some kind, but the strongest souls can transcend even that and command the world like it's their personal playground.

## Soul Characteristics
- Souls exist in everyone. They are their connection to the world, and inform their character traits, personality, and views. One cannot directly control their soul, but their mind and body inform the amount of control over the world they are able to exert. The mind influences what control you can exert (like deciding to do a backflip) and the body influences how strong that influence can be (i.e.  even if you decide to do a backflip, if your leg is broken you're not gonna be able to)
- Most of the time, one soul cannot influence another directly (like using an ability directly on top of another person)
	- There are exceptions to this, however, such as a strong enough soul being able to [[Genie|detach a piece of itself and attach it to someone else]].
		- Most people do not have a strong enough soul for this, and if they attempted it would probably fail or die
	- While you cannot directly influence another person's soul with your ability, you can influence their mind
