“Today’s the day.”

Mick’s eyes flew open. With excitement rippling through his heart and a beaming smile plastered across his face, he leapt out of his bed with all the force he could muster. Maybe a little too much force, actually. In his excitement, his explosion had carried him higher than he anticipated, and with a loud THUNK, he bashed his skull into the ceiling of his room. All the energy that had been flowing through him seconds prior was instantly replaced with a throbbing pain. Clutched his head groaning, he fell back onto his mattress, which quickly bounced him onto the floor. As he rolled around wallowing in his self-inflicted misery, his ears quickly perked up to the sound of loud footsteps approaching the closed door to his room. Uh oh. He recognized that sound. The feeling of pain was once again rapidly substituted by panic and a desire to escape the oncoming earful, and he scrambled to his feet and leapt onto his bed. He threw open the unlocked window that presided just behind his bedframe, and prepared himself to jump down to the beckoning call of freedom below. Unfortunately, he was just a second too late. The door to his room swung open, and every nerve in his body froze as a booming voice swept through the whole room. 

“MICK SINGER!”

Crap. Both names. Mick swiveled his head around sheepishly, a nervous smile plastered across his face. “I--, uh--...” he stammered, trying to think up any reason why he could possibly have one foot hanging out of his window 20 feet in the air, but he was swiftly cut off. Anything he’d prepared to say quickly caught in his throat.

“WHERE do you think you’re going?”

Mick finally pulled his leg free from the window, and swiveled his body enough for his eyes to meet those of the person standing in his doorway. Despite her short stature, his mother held a commanding presence that was nearly impossible to ignore. And with her face clearly straining to keep her anger in check, he knew something was severely wrong.

“Tell me why I’m working hard downstairs to serve our good paying customers their food, and suddenly a loud sound gives everyone on the premises a scare?” her voice came out more like a hiss as it was clearly taking everything within her to stay calm. Her foot tapped impatiently, the sound reverberating throughout the room like a rattlesnake gearing up to claim its newest prey. “And then I enter your room, to find my home, that I pay good money to maintain, once again severely damaged?”

“Huh? What’s she talking about?” Mick’s eyes followed hers upwards, until they landed the spot where his leap had taken him moments prior. In the ceiling of his room now lay a massive crack, originating from directly above his bed in the corner of his room all the way to center. Amidst all the pain and the panic, he’d failed to notice his mistake.

  

The reality of the situation was setting in.. Mick

Mick walked down the street, huffing and swinging at the ground with a stick he’d picked up along the side of the street all the way. 

  

“Who does she think she is?” he grumbled to himself, smacking a small rock to the side. “The most important day of my life! I woke up early to ensure that I wouldn’t miss my chance, and she decides THIS is the day to make me do chores?!?” He paused for a moment. “Err, hold on. I suppose that whole incident was technically my fault…” I (Maybe he hits himself in the shin with the stick cause it’s funny idk)
