As a kid, Mick is taken into the woods by a few older kids who want to prank him. They intend to scare him a little bit, but end up getting scared by the noises in the woods and run away. Mick is left to fend for himself, but when the villagers manage to organize and march into the woods and find him, they encounter him chilling with the wildlife, completely unscathed. Ever since then, Mick has gone into the woods by himself frequently to hang out with the animals, constantly coming back mysteriously unharmed.
