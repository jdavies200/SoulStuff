The afternoon sun shone down on the outskirts of a [[Small Town|Small Town]]. A crowd of people were gathered on the edge of a large field, but despite the large assembly, not a word was being spoken. Every one of the townsfolk was staring across the field with bated breath, trying to get a glimpse into the surrounding forest. Their focuses were locked as if in a trance, and what felt like minutes passed by before the silence was broken. A tall, middle-aged man near the front of the pack clicked his tongue.

“It better be Mick this time, Umi.” The man folded his arms, his brow furrowing as his gaze remained fixed on the trees. “I’ve got too much money riding on this one.”

The woman standing next to him chuckled. “We’ll see, we’ll see. My son has always been good with animals, at any rate.”

The man smirked. “I don’t know if this is the type of situation where those skills’d be applied.”

Umi remained unfazed. “You’d be surprised. At the end of the day, adaptability is what matters most.”

*BOOM*

A loud crash erupted from amidst the trees, immediately drawing any errant attention right back to the scene. Out from the forest shot a lone figure, a young boy of average height but a notably lean muscular build, barrelling backwards as if shot from a cannon. He hit the ground rolling, tumbling backwards head over heels before slamming into the trunk of a lone large oak tree in the midst of the field.

The man clicked his tongue again, throwing his hands up into the air in an acceptance of defeat. “I should’ve known. How many times has it been now? That thing is just too much for him.” He turned back towards the crowd, pulling his wallet out of his pocket. “Alright, who do I owe?”

Umi smiled, her gaze still fixed forwards. “Don’t be so hasty, Palmer. Take a look back out there.”

Palmer rolled his eyes, turning to face Umi. “We both just saw that blow he took, Umi. C’mon, there’s no way--”

He was cut off by the sight in the center of the field. Mick was back up, steadying himself against the trunk with one hand and wiping his brow with the other.

“I’m telling you.” Umi sat down on the ground with a look of satisfaction strewn across her face. “That’s my boy out there. I know strength better than anyone.”

Mick stared at his hand. Alongside the sweat from his forehead, crimson stains spotted his wrist. He was bleeding, but that wasn't where his focus lay. His hand was trembling. Mere moments had passed since he’d taken that heavy blow, but the rapid footsteps of the one that dealt it were quickly growing closer and louder. His whole body was shaking at the approaching danger, and his brief moment of respite came to an end. Out from the forest entrance came barreling a massive shadow. Once the hulking mass exited the trees, it slowed to a crawl, panning the field for the opponent it had just knocked clean across. As it marched forwards, the sunlight finally gave form to an enormous grizzly bear, at least twice as large as the boy, and three times as heavy. Even at a glance, it was easy to tell its fangs and claws were large and sharp enough to tear through objects much tougher than any man. The boy stared straight ahead at his assailant. His fists were shaking now more than ever. If there had been any time left for escape, it was long gone. And stretched upon his face was an expression that exposed the truth of his feelings in this desperate situation. A massive, gleeful smile.

Mick let out a boisterous laugh, loud enough to be heard by the bear and the onlookers alike on either side of the field. 

“THAT WAS A GOOD ONE, ELI!!!” The boy cheered, his whole demeanour shining with sheer giddiness. The blow he’d taken had not fazed him. Instead, he was trembling from utter excitement. Eager to return to the offensive, he crouched down into a ready stance,  “YOU REALLY GOT ME THAT TIME!” He,. 

The energy Eli was exuding was not a one-sided affair. The bear was also Eli let out a massive, guttural roar as it closed the distance between the two in seconds. It swung down its massive claw, a blow aimed directly at Mick’s head. He narrowly ducked the attack, and the bear’s paw crashed through the bark of the tree behind him, leaving a massive gash that threatened to topple the large, sturdy hardwood in its entirety. A second swing from the bear’s other paw threatened to knock the boy away, much the same as what had sent him flying out of the forest. 

Quickly pivoting on the ball of his foot, he turned to face the oak tree behind him. Using the gash in the trunk as a foothold, he shoved off towards the bear’s head, right in the line of the incoming claw swipe. He twisted around in midair and launched a left hook that connected with the rough skin of Eli’s paw, blowing the bear’s arm backwards and knocking the beast off balance just long enough for the boy to reach its head. In one fluid motion, he swiveled around its large neck and landed on its back, grappling its neck in a chokehold. Eli roared and thrashed around wildly, trying to throw him off, but his grip held fast. What felt like a long struggle between the two in truth only lasted a matter of seconds, before a loud cracking sound diverted the attention of both combatants. The gash that Ei had left in its trunk had left the oak tree unable to support its weight, and its trunk was now crumbling, listing in the direction of their bout. Eli bucked further, but the combination of Mick’s grip and the new threat of the falling tree left the bear disconcerted, cementing its position within the tree’s falling path. The boy smiled, knowing the end of the battle was imminent. Just as the oak was about to crush them both, he released his grip and leapt off of the bear’s back. With a large *CRASH* Eli's large body was pinned to the ground. Mick was victorious. 

The crowd looked on in stunned silence. Palmer looked down at Umi, searching as if somewhere within her face lay the adequate words to describe the spectacle they had just witnessed. There was naught to be found there, however, as she lay asleep in the grass, snoring loudly. She hadn’t even seen the last few moments of the fight. Somehow, Palmer got the sense that that was intentional.

Mick squatted next to his fallen opponent, peering into the bear's eyes. The smile on his face yet remained, though it had shifted from one of giddiness to one of satisfaction and contentment. He extended a hand towards Eli,
