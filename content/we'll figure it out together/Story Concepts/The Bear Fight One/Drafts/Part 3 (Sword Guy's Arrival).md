# That thing was too big to be called a sword.  
Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron.
The villagers watched in awe as [[Sword Kick Guy|the boy]], wrapped in tattered clothes and gaunt in the face, dragged it along behind him, the weapon kicking up dust and dirt all the while. As he hobbled along, he looked up with pleading eyes. His mouth parted as if to speak, but only two words managed to escape his dry, cracked lips before he topped over, his sword crashing to the ground beside him.

*"Food... Please..."*

Nobody was sure what to make of the spectacle.
