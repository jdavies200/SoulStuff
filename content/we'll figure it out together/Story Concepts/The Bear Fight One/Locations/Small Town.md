This is where Mick fights the bear

There are a few buildings and I like to thing Umi owns a restaurant or bar of some kind here where she meets people

It is a small town, but gets a fair few visitors thanks to a large road between larger places passing nearby.

On the Eastern outskirts of the town there is a large field with a lone tree in the centre, and then [[The Forest]] farther out.

The residents of the town avoid the forest, as they feel it is dangerous. Some of the older folks in the town spread rumours of a strange energy coming out of the forest, while the younger members simply avoid it due to the dangerous wildlife that lies within.
